POINTS :

1- 	The class whose object’s copy is to be made must have a public/protected clone method in it 
	or in one of its parent class.
	
2-	Every class that implements clone() should call super.clone() to obtain the cloned object reference.

3-	The class must also implement java.lang.Cloneable interface whose object clone we want to create 
	otherwise it will throw CloneNotSupportedException when clone method is called on that class’s object.
	
4-	If only primitive type fields or Immutable objects are there then there is no difference 
	between shallow and deep copy in Java.
