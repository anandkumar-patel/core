Java Regex classes are present in java.util.regex package 

This contains three classes:

1- Pattern: 
	Pattern object is the compiled version of the regular expression. 
	Pattern class doesn’t have any public constructor and 
	we use it’s public static method compile to create the pattern object by passing regular expression argument.

2- Matcher: 
	Matcher is the java regex engine object that matches the input String pattern 
	with the pattern object created. Matcher class doesn’t have any public constructor and 
	we get a Matcher object using pattern object matcher method that takes the input String 
	as argument. We then use matches method that returns boolean result based on input 
	String matches the regex pattern or not.

3- PatternSyntaxException: 
	PatternSyntaxException is thrown if the regular expression syntax is not correct.
