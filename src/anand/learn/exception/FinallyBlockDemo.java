/*
OutPut:
Starting thread
Here if you comment the line  t.setDaemon(true);
Then the finally block will be executed.
Here the sleep time of the main thread is 1 sec(1000milisec). 
If you will make it 5 second then you can see the finally block of 
the daemon thread will be executed.

POINT:
When a thread is set to be a daemon thread then the finally block 
may not be executed. If it get sufficient time that other threads(non-daemon) 
are executing then it will execute the finally block.
