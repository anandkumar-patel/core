/*
 * 
 * Given a set of integers, find if there is a subset which has a sum equal to S where S can be any integer. 
 * For example, in set = {2,4,5,3}, if  S= 6, answer should be True as there is a subset {2,4} which sum up to 6. 
 * However, for the same set if S = 10, answer would be False as there is no subset which adds up to 10.
