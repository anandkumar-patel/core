** If superclass doesnâ€™t have default constructor/zero param constructor, 
then subclass also needs to have an explicit constructor defined. 
Else it will throw compile time exception. In the subclass constructor, 
call to superclass constructor is mandatory in this case and it should be the 
first statement in the subclass constructor.
