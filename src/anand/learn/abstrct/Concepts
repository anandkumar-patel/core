1- An abstract method can only set a visibility modifier of public or protected. 
   That is, an abstract method cannot add static or final modifier to the declaration. 

2-When Should I use an Abstract class ???
Answer :We should go for abstract class when we are working with classes that contains similar code. 
That is, there is a possibility to template behavior and attributes. Common behavior can be elevated 
to a super class and provide implementation to it. Then add behavior that cannot be implemented and 
declare it as abstract. Classes that are similar to this abstract class will extend it and use the 
already implemented methods and add implementation for abstract methods.
