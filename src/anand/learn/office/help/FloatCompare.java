         * Examples:

  	Large Numbers: Scientific notation is not only used for small 
  	numbers but also for large numbers. 
  	For example, 3e7 means 3 multiplied by 10^7, which is 30,000,000.

    Smaller Exponents: The exponent can also be a positive integer. 
    For example, 2e3 means 2 multiplied by 10^3, which is 2,000.

    Negative Exponents: As in your original question, 
    when the exponent is negative, it represents a small decimal fraction. 
    For instance, 5e-4 means 5 multiplied by 10^(-4), which is 0.0005.
